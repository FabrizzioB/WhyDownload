# YtDownloader
## YouTube Downloader with GUI written in Python

### Remember when back in the days you needed to find a tool to download music to put in your walkman mp3?
### This is that tool but in 2023 lol

#### Instructions 

To create the executable file run the following command in the terminal:

pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile .\YouTubeDownloader.py

pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile YouTubeDownloader.py


## Note 1: You don't need to create an exacutable to use this application, just run it normally in terminal.
## Note 2: If you create an exacutable in Windows, be aware of the "Virus" that is created.
